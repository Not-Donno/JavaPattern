# JavaPatternPractice

This project is a collection of classic text-based patterns written in **Java** using **Maven**. It is intended for practice and understanding of nested loops, conditionals, and output formatting.

## ðŸ”· Patterns Implemented

### â—† Diamond Pattern  
This pattern creates a symmetrical diamond shape made of asterisks *. It consists of two parts: the upper half, which starts with one star and gradually increases in width, and the lower half, which is a mirror image of the upper half, decreasing in width. This pattern is great for practicing nested loops and understanding how to print shapes that are symmetrical both horizontally and vertically.

**Preview:**
`   *   `
`  ***  `
` ***** `
`******* `
` ***** `
`  ***  `
`   *   `
 ### ðŸªœ Stairs Pattern.
The Stairs pattern prints a right-angled staircase. The number of rows represents the steps, with each step containing an increasing number of stars *. This pattern is useful for understanding how to create progressively longer lines with each iteration of a loop.

**Preview:**
`*`
`***`
`*****`
`*******`
`*********`
`***********`

### ðŸŽ„ Tree Pattern.
The Tree pattern creates a tree-like structure with stars *, resembling a Christmas tree or a simple cone shape. The tree is topped with a single star, followed by wider layers of stars on each level. At the base, a vertical trunk (|) is added for structure. This pattern is useful for visualizing hierarchical structures or creating a simple tree shape with multiple levels.

**Preview:**
`      *`
`     ***`
`    *****`
`   *******`
`  *********`
` ***********`
`     |||`
`     |||`

### ðŸ”º Triangle Pattern.
The Triangle pattern prints a right-angled triangle, where each row contains an increasing number of stars *. This pattern is useful for understanding how to incrementally increase the number of characters printed on each line, forming a triangular shape.

**Preview:**
`      *`
`     ***`
`    *****`
`   *******`
`  *********`
` ***********`
